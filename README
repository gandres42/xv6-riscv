Gavin Andres - a fork of xv6-risv for COMS-352
CHANGELOG --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project 1C:
    - Added system calls nice, startcfs, stopcfs
      nice returns the nice score for the current process
      startcfs changes the scheduler from the original RR to CFS
      stopcfs sets the scheduler to the original RR
    - Add CFS scheduler to proc.c, replacing original scheulder function with toggle for scheduler functions that
      swaps between the RR and CFS schedulers 
    - Add program testsyscall, which spawns 10 child processes and runs the CFS scheduler
Project 1B:
    - Added system calls getppid, getcpid, and getswapcount
      getppid returns pid of current process, -1 on failure
      getcpid returns the current process' child count and reads their PIDs into a buffer.  Returns -1 on failure.
      getswaycount returns the number of times process has been swapped off CPU, returns -1 on failure
    - Add program systest to test the added system calls, code provided by course admin
